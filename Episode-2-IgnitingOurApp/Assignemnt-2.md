1. what is bundler, webpack/parcel? Why do we need it?
    A bundler is a tool used in web development to combine multiple files, such as JavaScript, CSS, and other assets, into a single file or a set of files. The primary purpose of a bundler is to improve the performance and efficiency of web applications by reducing the number of HTTP requests required to load a page.

    When building complex web applications, developers often organize their code into multiple modules or files for better organization, modularity, and reusability. However, loading numerous separate files over the network can result in increased latency and slower page load times.

    A bundler solves this problem by analyzing the dependencies between different files, traversing the dependency graph, and bundling them together into one or more optimized files. This process includes combining the code from multiple modules, resolving import statements, managing dependencies, and applying optimizations such as minification and compression.

    By bundling all the required files into a single bundle or a few bundles, the number of network requests can be reduced, leading to faster loading times and improved performance. Bundlers also enable the use of newer JavaScript features, such as modules, that may not be natively supported by all web browsers.

    Some popular bundlers in the JavaScript ecosystem include:

    1. webpack: A highly configurable and widely used bundler that supports not only JavaScript but also other assets like CSS, images, and fonts.

    2. Parcel: A zero-configuration bundler that simplifies the setup process and provides out-of-the-box support for various file types.

    3. Rollup: A module bundler primarily focused on creating smaller bundles optimized for library or package distribution.

    Bundlers have become an essential part of modern web development workflows, allowing developers to write modular code while optimizing the delivery of assets to end users.

2. `.parcel-cache` folder in parcel.
    When you run Parcel to bundle your project, it analyzes your source files, resolves dependencies, and generates the output bundles. To speed up subsequent builds, Parcel caches the compiled and transformed versions of your files in the `.parcel-cache` directory.

    The cache directory stores the intermediate artifacts and metadata generated during the bundling process. This cache helps improve build performance by avoiding unnecessary recompilations of files that haven't changed since the previous build. When you run Parcel again, it can quickly check the cache to determine if a file needs to be rebuilt or if it can reuse the cached output.


3. what is npx?
    Npx is a command-line tool that comes bundled with NPM (Node Package Manager) starting from version 5.2.0. It is used to execute Node.js packages directly without the need to install them globally or locally.

    The primary purpose of npx is to make it easy to run command-line tools and executables that are distributed as npm packages. Instead of having to install these tools globally on your system, you can use npx to run them on-demand.

    When you run a command with npx, it first checks if the package required by the command is installed in your local node_modules directory. If the package is not found, npx automatically installs it temporarily and runs the command using the installed package. This eliminates the need to install and manage global dependencies for individual projects.

4. What is tree shaking?
    Tree shaking is a technique used in modern JavaScript build tools and bundlers, such as Webpack, Rollup, and Parcel, to eliminate unused code (dead code) from the final bundled output. It is named after the concept of shaking a tree to remove dead leaves.

    In JavaScript applications, developers often import entire libraries or modules to use only a small portion of their functionality. Tree shaking analyzes the static structure of the code and determines which parts are actually used or referenced. It then removes the unused code during the bundling process, resulting in a smaller bundle size and improved performance.

    The process of tree shaking involves static analysis of the code and building a dependency graph to track the usage of various functions, classes, and variables. If a module or function is not used or its usage cannot be traced from the entry point, it is considered dead code and can be safely eliminated.

    Tree shaking is particularly effective with modules that follow the ES6 module syntax, as it provides clear static boundaries for analysis. It relies on the fact that ES6 modules are statically analyzable, unlike CommonJS modules which have dynamic behavior that makes it harder to determine the actual usage.

    By removing dead code, tree shaking reduces the size of the JavaScript bundle sent to the browser, resulting in faster load times and improved performance. It also helps optimize the execution of the code by eliminating unnecessary computations, reducing memory usage, and enabling better caching.

    However, for tree shaking to work effectively, the codebase needs to be written in a way that allows for proper static analysis. This means avoiding dynamic imports, conditionally importing modules, or using dynamic property access, as these can hinder the tool's ability to accurately determine the code that is actually used.

    Overall, tree shaking is an important optimization technique in modern JavaScript build processes that helps eliminate unused code, leading to smaller and more efficient bundles.

5. What is Hot Module Replacement?
    Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature commonly used in web development to improve the developer experience during the development process. It allows you to update the code of a running application without the need for a full page reload or losing the application state.

    With HMR, as you make changes to your code, the modified modules are automatically replaced in the running application, preserving its current state. This means you can see the immediate effect of your code changes in the browser without manually refreshing the page or losing any temporary data or application state.

    During the HMR process, the modified module is injected into the running application and the necessary updates are applied. This can include updating the component tree, applying new styles, or re-rendering specific parts of the application.

    HMR is not limited to JavaScript code. It can also handle updates to CSS stylesheets, allowing you to see changes in the appearance of your application in real-time.

6. difference between package.json and package-lock.json?
    The `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files are both used in the context of Node.js projects and package management with NPM. However, they serve different purposes and have distinct roles:

    1. package.json:
    - The `package.json` file is the main configuration file for a Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project, such as the project name, version, author, dependencies, and other settings.
    - It is manually created and edited by developers to define project-specific configurations, including the project's dependencies and their versions.
    - It is used to declare the project's dependencies, both direct dependencies and their respective versions, along with other metadata like scripts, project description, license, etc.
    - It is typically committed to the project's version control system (e.g., Git) and shared with other developers.
    - When running `npm install` or `npm ci`, NPM reads the `package.json` file to determine which dependencies to install and resolve their versions based on the defined dependencies and version ranges.

    2. package-lock.json:
    - The `package-lock.json` file is automatically generated by NPM when installing or updating dependencies. It provides a detailed, deterministic lock file that ensures consistent and reproducible installations of packages across different environments.
    - It includes the complete tree of installed dependencies, their versions, and additional metadata like integrity hashes.
    - The purpose of the `package-lock.json` file is to lock down the specific versions of all the packages installed in a project, including nested dependencies, to create a consistent environment for development and deployment.
    - It prevents unexpected changes in package versions and avoids introducing compatibility issues when multiple developers or deployment environments work with the same project.
    - The `package-lock.json` file is automatically updated by NPM whenever you run commands like `npm install` or `npm update`.

    In summary, `package.json` is a manually maintained configuration file that defines project-level settings and dependencies, while `package-lock.json` is an automatically generated lock file that ensures consistent installations by locking down specific versions of packages and their dependencies.
